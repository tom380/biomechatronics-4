# Model #

Use this directory for user code. Students can use this directory to place their own models.

To get started, copy the `muscle_model.default.py` file and rename the copy to `muscle_model.py`. So afterwards there will be two *.py files in this directory.

When running the program, the new non-default file will be detected, and the model it provides will be used.

If you cloned this repository, the file `muscle_model.py` is ignored by Git. So pulling updates will never overwrite your own code in that file.
